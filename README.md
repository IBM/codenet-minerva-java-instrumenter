# Project Minerva for Modernization - Java Binary Instrumenter
Project Minerva for Modernization is a set of libraries to analyze Java applications using AI and provide recommendations for refactoring them into partitions, which can be starting points for microservices. This binary instrumenter component enables the instrumenting of a running Java application's classes and methods in order to collect data for AI refactoring consideration.
